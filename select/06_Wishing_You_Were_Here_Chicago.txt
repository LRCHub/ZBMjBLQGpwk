Sleepless hours and dreamless nights and far aways
Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here
Heaven knows and Lord it shows when I'm away
Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here

Same old show, in a different town, on another time
Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here
Even though you're far away, you're on my mind
Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here
Oooooh, oooooh, oooooh, oooooh
Oooooh, oooooh, oooooh, oooooh

And I'd like to change my life, and you know I would
Just to be with you tonight, baby, if I could
But I've got my job to do, and I do it well
Oh, so I guess that's how it is

Ooo, wishing you were here
Ooo, wishing you were here
Ooo, wishing you were here
Ooo, wishing you were here

On the road, it's a heavy load, but I'll get by
Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here
Pay the price, make a sacrifice, and still I'll try
Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here

Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here
Ooh, wishing you were, wishing you were here (wishing you were here)
(Wishing)
